# Dictionary for Devs

Dictionary for Devs was an idea created by Jess Lark and used as a project by the Phoenix React Meetup Group. Later, during Hacktobertfest 2018, Jess started a fresh approach to the DFD as a shallow dive into open source. The DFD is a collection of terms, phrases, and acronyms that are assumed knowledge in the dev community but may be unfamiliar to new, or even seasoned, developers.

# Possible TODO

Implememnt Sass
Make header, footer, and search smaller and sticky

Clean up code, move pieces into appropriate components, order functions appropriately
Make scrollToTop smooth
Update search to allow for searching on words or defs or both
Allow for multiple definitions
Specifically add an ELI5 defintion for each term
Consider useReducer instead of useState
Improve design
Move dictionary content into database
Add functionality for users to add definitions to database
Add funcationality for moderators to clean up any issues
Consider pulling in dictionary defs (or some other source) from an API
Add code snippets for explanations where appropriate
Add links to defs where appropriate

# Create React App 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
